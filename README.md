# Daisy_Chain_Priority_Logic_Block
This is a VHDL model of a daisy chain logic block that is used to determine the priorities of multiple interrupt sources. Atypical Daisy chain consists of many such block connected sequentially. This block decides whether to propagate the interrupt acknowledgement signal to next block or not.
